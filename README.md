Y’know, it’s \${new Date().getFullYear()} and some services still don’t let you upload images, instead asking for an image URL.

This little web application lets you upload a file to Google Drive.
Once uploaded, the sharing settings will be changed to “Anyone with the link can view,”
and a direct URL to the file is generated for you, ready for copying.

You can choose the output format (just URL, Markdown, or customize it yourself).
